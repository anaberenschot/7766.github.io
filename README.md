Hello world

My name is Ana Carolina and I am brazilian, i moved to the Netherlands 2 years ago and i am currently studying in Ds Pierson College in Den Bosch.
I love to read books in my free time and i also like to run in the park sometimes (my dream is being able of running a marathon one day), this whole year has been so hard and different for me because i started to study in a dutch school last year even not being fluent in dutch yet, but i see this as a crazy  experience in my life.
I really enjoy watching movies (way more then series to be honest) and i also listen music 24 hours every day hahaha...I have been thinking lately about my future and what kind off job i want to have but that is actually a tough deciason to make but i guess i want to become a doctor (dermatologist).
